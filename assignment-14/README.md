# Moodle Questions:

1. My user testing went well! Unfortunetly, I was only able to test one person, but to my surprise, they found my site fairly straighforward and easy to navigate. 

2. Based on my feedback, I am planning on making a few changes to my site. First of all, I think I'm going to add some kind of footer to make everything more appealing. Second, I want to add borders to a couple things. The one that stuck out most was the photo in my "about" section. Third, I would like to make another page under the "portfolio" section that acts as a hub for my "photos," "videos," and "other productions" tabs. Fourth, I need to make sure that my dropdown menu is perfectly flush with my "portfolio" tab. Lastly, I need to add photos to the "photos" section under my portfolio.
