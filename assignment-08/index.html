            LYRICS
        </h1>
            Taking me down, where is the place?
            <br>
            Calling a cab, showing up late
            <br>
            Now that it's all already waste
            <br>
            Who will you be?
            <br>
            Your coffee to go is hotter than Hades
            <br>
            Some people line up to see a Mercedes
            <br>
            Call it a car, then call it a lady
            <br>
            What'll it be?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Time won't take nothing, believe me
            <br>
            It's you that takes the time
            <br>
            Tell me if what makes you someone is something
            <br>
            Then why can't I have mine?
            <br>
            I've waited so long
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Take it again, edit the face
            <br>
            Love what you see, copy and paste
            <br>
            Isn't it magic? Don't you want to have it
            <br>
            And say it's all mine? (That's mine)
            <br>
            Compile the content, you're filming a mosh pit
            <br>
            You ship it and box it right to your doorstep
            <br>
            Ain't it a wonder that we're going under
            <br>
            But everyone's high?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Time won't take nothing, believe me
            <br>
            It's you that takes the time
            <br>
            Tell me if what makes you someone is something
            <br>
            Then why can't I have mine?
            <br>
            I've waited so long
