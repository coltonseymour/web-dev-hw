# Forms:
The most common forms I have come across on the internet are a contact forms and payment forms. I have also found a few that that allow you to leave comments and give feedback to companies/businesses/websites. Forms are a nice addition to a website becuase it allows users to import information for a multitude of different purposes. The possibilities are virtually endless.
